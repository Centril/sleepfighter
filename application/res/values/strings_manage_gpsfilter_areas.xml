	<p><b>Location Filter</b> lets you <b>avoid embarrasing moments</b> like when the alarm rings during a lecture or meeting.</p>
	<p>It lets you setup areas you must be in <i><font color=\"#00ddff\">(include)</font></i> and/or areas you can\'t be in <i><font color=\"#ff4444\">(exclude)</font></i> for an alarm to ring.
		<font color=\"#ff4444\">Exclude</font> has highest priority.</p>
	<p>Tap the plus / add button to add an area.</p>
	<p>Note that location providers may be <b>inaccurate</b>, so give as wide of a range as possible.</p>
