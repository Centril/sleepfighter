# SleepFighter

An Android alarm app developed for the Software Engineering course DAT255 at Chalmers University of Technology (CTH).

## Project Vision

For sleepy people who want a fun way to quickly wake up, SleepFighter is an alarm app that compels the user to wake up faster. Unlike other alarm apps, our product is hard to turn off in a drowsy state, as it requires the focus of the user in order to solve one of many short, engaging and creative challenges.
